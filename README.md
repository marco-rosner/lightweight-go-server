## Lightweight Go Server

A performance comparison to find the lightweight Go server using Echo, Gin and Fiber servers. We will use MongoDB and Postegres as database and Docker compose as container enviorement. We will use some of the rules from [Rinha de beckend](https://github.com/zanfranceschi/rinha-de-backend-2023-q3) to get the results.

## Run server

```go
go run .
```

## Run with Docker compose

Make sure that you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed and run `docker-compose up -d`
